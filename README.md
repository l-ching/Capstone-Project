## Introduction:
Like many people, the three of us have a passion for the outdoors, and we specifically love the national parks. Also like many other people, we haven't had time to visit all 62 of them, or even know about all of them.

This readme will expound upon the details of digging into the source code if you want to see how everything works under the hood. However, the best way to use the tool is to go to our hosted Streamlit app [here](https://l-ching-capstone-project-capstone-sl-th8bn9.streamlit.app/) and start playing around with it yourself. If you want to run it locally or peek under the hood though, read on!
